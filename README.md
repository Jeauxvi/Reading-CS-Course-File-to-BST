# Reading-CS-Course-File-to-BST
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem I was solving in this course was, picking the right data structure to store data from a file, and finding an algorithm that uses the best case time complexity with that data structure.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I conderided the data in the file, and how it was going to be used. I made diagrams of the data in both a hash table and binary search tree. After brain storming for a while, I determined that a binary search tree would be the best fit for this problem.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  All the road blockes that I've reached when working through the project, I was able to overcome by reseach and reading documentation to understand the code I have found in my reasearch.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  My work on this project changed the way I plan ahead before diving into the code. I now spend more time designing the program than writting the code for the program. I also consider more things in my design, such as run time complexty and data structures.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   My work on this projct helped me evolve in the way I write comments. I wrote hignlighted comments to explain what each method does in the program, which will help with any maintenance that needs to be done. Using the right data structure and algorithms will ensure that the program is adaptable to changes in the future.
